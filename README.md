# MONSTER PUNCH - TESTING TASK

Create a game where you defend against some threat(s). The game mechanics should be humorous and rely substantially on physics. Please include some basic UI such as a score display or progress bar or timer bar.

Time frame: Spend about 8 hours on this task. Spending more time is allowed. You can spread out the hours across multiple days.

Coding: You are encouraged to use object-oriented programming principles. In other words, use class-based systems that rely on tables or objects.

Artwork and Models: Use basic primitives or public models for this task. No need to create new models, unless necessary for your game. You won't be judged on the art.

You are allowed to use any supplemental frameworks (like Knit) or libraries to speed up your development.

On completion, please provide a link to play your game on Roblox. For your code, send me a link to your GitHub repo.

What we are looking for from this assignment:

1. Creativity in designing your game.
2. Demonstrated understanding of what makes a fun Roblox game.
3. How your code is structured.
4. How you tackled the challenge of this assignment (the choices you made).
5. How much progress you made within the time frame (speed of execution).

You will be graded on code clarity, reusability, organization, and execution.
